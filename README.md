## ✨ Implemented Features & Core Logic

### 1. 🎮 Advanced Gamification Engine
Our core engine is designed to turn productivity into an addictive, rewarding experience.
- **XP System**: Users earn Experience Points (XP) for completing tasks. Rewards are scaled based on task priority (Low: 10XP, Medium: 25XP, High: 50XP).
- **Dynamic Leveling**: A progressive leveling system ($Level = floor(XP / 100)$) with visual progress tracking.
- **Achievement System**: 15+ automated achievements (e.g., "First Steps", "Task Master", "Level 10 Legend") with unique icon badges and XP bonuses.
- **Streak Calculation**: Monitors consecutive days of activity. Maintaining a streak provides XP multipliers and unlocks special achievements.

### 2. 🗓️ Google Calendar Integration (OAuth2)
Seamlessly bridge your digital life with your productivity goals.
- **Full OAuth2 Flow**: Securely connect your Google account via a professional-grade OAuth2 handshake.
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Push tasks from the local dashboard directly to a "Task Manager" calendar in Google.
- **Real-time Status**: Tracking system that remembers which tasks have already been synced to prevent duplicates.

### 3. 📝 Comprehensive Task Management
A robust foundation for day-to-day organization.
- **Full CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks with a modern UI.
- **Rich Task Data**: Support for Descriptions, Categories, Tags, Due Dates, and Priority levels.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Live search and status-based filtering (All, Pending, Completed).

### 4. 🛡️ Security & Integrity
Built with industry-standard security protocols.
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens for secure session management.
- **Argon2 Hashing**: Modern, memory-hard password hashing that protects user credentials against brute-force attacks.
- **Protected Routes**: Granular middleware that enforces authentication and authorizations across all sensitive API endpoints.
- **CORS Protection**: Hardened Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policy for production safety.

### 5. 📧 Email Service (Mailtrap/Gmail)
- **Email Verification**: Automated verification tokens sent upon registration to ensure valid user identities.
- **Password Recovery**: Secure, time-limited tokens for password resets via email.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Infrastructure

### 🧩 Core Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.12), SQLAlchemy (Async), Pydantic v2.
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Material UI v5, Axios.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic Migrations.
- **Nginx**: Production reverse proxy for the frontend container.

### 🚀 DevOps & CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Fully automated linting (Ruff/ESLint) and image building.
- **Docker Hub**: Automated builds of production-ready images.
- **Render Blueprints**: Infrastructure-as-Code (`render.yaml`) for predictable, repeatable cloud deployments.

## 🏁 Production Launch Checklist

To allow **any** Google account to connect, you must update your Google Cloud Console settings:

1.  Go to **[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)** -> **APIs & Services** -> **OAuth Consent Screen**.
2.  Find **Publishing Status** and click **"PUBLISH APP"**.
    *   *Note: Currently, your app is in "Testing" mode, which limits access to specific "Test Users".*
3.  Confirm the change. Now, any Google account will be able to sync their calendar with TaskMaster!
